<p>If your child has a disability, you are his or her most important advocate. You may need information about your childâ€™s disability, early intervention (for a baby or toddler), school services (for a school-aged child), therapy, transportation, and much more.

Help is available. Every state has at least one parent training and information center (PTI) to offer families just this kind of information. Many states also have a community parent resource center (CPRC), which offers the same type of support and training to parents of children with disabilities.

Caring for Children with Special Health Care Needs (CHSCN) in Early Care and Education is a collection of 146 nationally recognized health and safety standards that have an impact on infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with special health care needs in early care and education settings. These materials and the associated six Appendices are a subset of materials available in Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs (CFOC). CFOC is a collection of nationally recognized best practice health and safety standards for the early care and education environment. The CSHCN collection is a compilation of best practices for children with special health care needs in early care and education programs. All CFOC standards are applicable to children with special healthcare care needs. However, this collection of standards, when put into practice, is best able to meet the specific needs of this vulnerable population. Support for this project was provided through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and 
Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau.<br>
